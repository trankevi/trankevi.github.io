    <p>It's night time in a kitchen just like yours. All is quiet... or is it? The North American house potato is found throughout Cananda and the Eastern United States. House potatoes are very timid creatures and are rarely seen, but they will defend their territory if provoked. They come out at night to search for food, water, and materials for their nests. The favourite foods of the house potato are chips, raisins, and crumbs from peanut butter on toast. They build their nests in bedroom closets, using lost mittens, dryer lint, and bits of string. The nests have to be very soft and warm. House potatoes sleep for about 16 hours a day.</p>
